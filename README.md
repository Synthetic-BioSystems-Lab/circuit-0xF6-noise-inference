# circuit-0xF6-noise-inference
This repository contains code and data for modeling, simulating, and inferring the noise behavior of genetic circuit 0xF6. The project combines experimental time-series measurements with Bayesian parameter inference to characterize transcriptional and translational noise in a multi-gate logic circuit.
